# Project Name

> Plato is the revolutionary note-taking app that the internet needs. Spend less time mindlessly jotting down what your instructor is saying, and spend more time contemplating on the material being presented. With Plato, youâ€™re not limited by what you can type, but by what you can imagine. With an infinite canvas, speech-to-text recording, and locale-based chatrooms, you can spend less time taking notes and more time learning.
